 the intellisense list is built by parsing the *.bas files in the user specified /include directory.
 the [name].bas must match the included module [name] directive

 to show the intellisense list couple conditions: the file must be "include [name].bas" or "import [name].bas"
 in the script. the single space is important, case is not.

 the function prototypes are saved in the /dependancies/calltips.txt edit as desired.
 calltips for functions within modules should be below the #modules line show they dont
 show up in general intellisense lists.

 autocomplete is aware of module scoped functions and can match off of partial strings.
 if only one match is found for partial string, it will auto complete it for you automatically.

 when debugging, mouse over a variable for its current run time value. Click on the call tip
 of the value to edit the value. Strings and longs are supported.
