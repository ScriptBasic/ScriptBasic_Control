 the intellisense list is built by parsing the *.bas files in the user specified /include directory.
 the [name].bas must match the included module [name] directive

 to show the intellisense list couple conditions: the file must be "include [name].bas" or "import [name].bas"
 in the script. the single space is important, case is not.

 the function prototypes are saved in the /dependancies/calltips.txt edit as desired.
