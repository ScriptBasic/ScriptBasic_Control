'breakpoint strategy..so we want to save breakpoints across runs, but only allow
'them to be set at runtime debug mode because then line numbers are locked in
'and knowable (import statements pull entire files in)..

'if the source line text hasnt changed..we also need to clearUI breakpoints visually
'when the run ends. also we limit which lines breakpoints can be added on some if it
'doesnt look like executable code to make more sense.
