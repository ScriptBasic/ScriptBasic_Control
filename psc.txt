ScriptBasic Debugger
<br>

Script Basic is robust, GPL, cross platform
scripting engine using the Basic language written by
 Peter Verhás.
<br>

Wikipedia has a very good overview of the engine,
and capabilities:

I was looking for a basic scripting engine that I could
embed in my VB6 apps in place of the MS script control.
I also wanted one that had debugger support so that users
had debug functionality when scripting my apps.
<br>

There were four stages to see if I could use ScriptBasic for
this use
<br>

1) create a vb6 usable version of the script basic engine - complete
2) write a debugger GUI and integrate it with the engine - complete
3) write a COM extension to let scripts access VB6 objects - complete
4) wrap all the components together into an ocx control - not started
<br>

All of the hard stuff is complete, and came out really well. The
debugger supports single step, step over, breakpoints, run time variable
inspection, call stack, syntax highlighting, and all the GUI features
you would expect from a modern debugger.
<br>

You can see a demo of it in action here:

Due to tendonitius issues in my arms, I am no longer working on it, but
it is a significant codebase that I still wanted to share with others in 
case you have a need for a similar capabilities in your apps. 
<br>

The standalone debugger, script engine and COM extension are all complete
and quite useful on their own. Being able to embed it all would be the ultimate
feature, but it is really a complete app in what it is already.
<br>

I am posting this so people are aware of the project, and maybe pass the torch
on to other developers who would have the same vision for how awesome the final
goal could be.
